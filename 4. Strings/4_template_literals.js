// From all this time, the two `` backtilts i was using, are called template literals
// They help us to directly call any variable, object, object's key and almost everything

let a = 'Hello'

console.log(a, " World!"); // Normal Concatenation
console.log(`${a} World!`); // Template Literals

// here, they might seem more complecated, but as you go forward...
// everything will be more clear...
