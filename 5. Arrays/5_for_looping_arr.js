// Objective: Create a Loop that helps us to print each item of the array

let a = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];

for (let i = 0; i < (a.length); i++) {
    console.log(a[i]);
}

/*
Explanation:

1) First we created a simple vowels array

2) Then, we created the for loop

3) we initialised i as 0 as the arrays index point start from 0

4) here, to let the loop run unitl all item are printed we added a condition
for i to be less than the length(number of items) of the array 'a'.

5) then we simply printed all the array items by simply metioning 'i' as their index.
